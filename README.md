# TITLE  :-  CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION


# DESCRIPTION  :-


Dataset contains the transaction from Europe card owners during September 2013. In this dataset 492 are fraud transactions out of 2,84,807 transactions.
Data is not balanced because less amount of fraud cases as compared to huge transaction data. 
Dataset is converted PCA transformation and contains only numeric values. Only time and amount are not transformed to PCA all other given values v1, v2, v3 . . . .. v28 are PCA transformed numeric values.
A dataset contains 31 columns and 284807 rows and dataset is highly imbalance. 
Imbalanced data distribution is overcome using sampling methods.


# PROBLEM STATEMENT  :-


Credit card frauds are happening in large amount and also some banking companies and the companies giving service to banks are facing problem. 
Every year due to fraud Billions of amounts lost. To analyze the fraud there is lack of research.
So many machine learning algorithms are implemented to detect real world credit card fraud. 


# OBJECTIVES  :-


The Objective of the project is to predict the fraud and fraud less transaction with respect to the time and amount of the transaction using classication machine learning algorithms. Feature class contains 1 for fraud and 0 for normal transaction.


# CONCLUSION  :-


Credit card fraud is most common problem resulting in loss of lot money for people and loss for some banks and credit card company. 
This project want to help the peoples from their wealth loss and also for the banked company and trying to develop the model which more efficiently separate the fraud and fraud less transaction by using the time and amount feature in dataset by using some machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression.


# RESULT  :-


By using dimensions of credit card fraud now anyone can easily predict the fraud transaction for class contains 1 and normal transaction for class contains 0.
